<h2>Lyrics
<p align="left">[Chorus]
I'm fallin' in deeper
She’s callin' my keeper
I wanted the reaper
Will end it, just let me go, no
But something brings me back to you</p>

<p align="left">[Verse 1]
She wouldn't tell me why
It's time to say goodbye
What did you do, what did you do?
Baby, just tell me lies
We runnin' out of time
Say that she can't decide (No)
It's up to you, it's up to you
We gonna live or die?
Lay me to rest in peace, yuh
Don't want your honesty, yuh
I wanna see you when
You're lying right here next to me</p>

<p align="left">
[Pre-Chorus]
She don't want me, but I burn inside
She don't wanna keep this heart of mine
She don't wanna leave, just one time
But when I fall asleep, gimme cyanide<?p>

<p align="left">[Chorus]
I'm fallin' in deeper
She’s callin' my keeper
I wanted the reaper
Will end it, just let me go, no
But something brings me back to you</p>
