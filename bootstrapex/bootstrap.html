<h1>What is a Bootstrap and why is it important?</h1>
<p>I personally do like responsive pages because they are very beneficial. In most cases, people do not 
   always have a computer with them so they cannot check the website they are looking for. So it's very useful when 
   mobile devices have the same websites. Responsive web design describes a web design approach that allows websites 
   and pages to displa on all devices and screen sizes by automatically adapting to the screen, whether it’s a desktop,
   laptop, tablet, or smartphone. Responsive web design works through CSS, using various settings
   to serve different style properties depending on the screen size, orientation, resolution, color capability, and other 
   characteristics of the user’s device. A few examples of CSS properties related to responsive web design include the viewport
   and media queries. Responsive pages matter because it relieves web designers, user interface designers, and web developers
   from working day and night creating websites for every single different device in existence. It also makes the lives of
   business owners, marketers, and advertisers easier.<p>
